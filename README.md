### `Acknowledgement`

The insight which i used in making this project was gotten from Chris Blakely in one of his Youtube tutorial.\
Open [Youtube](https://youtu.be/8hU0I8rY4u4) to view it in your browser.

### `How the Form Works`
The form was built using React. It allows users to input their first name, middle name, surname, email, age and gender. Post-registration, an error message is displayed for each field if validation fails else a success message is shown.

Validation Checks includes
- Email must contain @ Symbol
- Age must be in Numbers

### `Learning Outcome`

The Project Taught me more on React-hooks, Component and useState().

### `Challenges`
- The data typed in the box has no record yet. Once submitted it basically refreshes.. But the Success  and error messages is an indicator that our form is working and more improvement can kickstart from there.
- It isn't mobile responsive yet. Will Work on making it mobile responsive subsquent time. It is more enjoyed on desktop.
